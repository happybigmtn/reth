# Lesson 4: Blocks and Headers - The Containers of History

*"The only way to have real success in science... is to describe the evidence very carefully without regard to the way you feel it should be." - Richard Feynman*

Today we explore blocks - the fundamental units that make up the blockchain. If transactions are letters, then blocks are the mailbags that carry them through time.

## What Is a Block?

A block is a container with two parts:

1. **Header**: Metadata about the block (like an envelope)
2. **Body**: The actual transactions (like letters inside)

Together, they form an immutable record of what happened during a slice of time on the Ethereum network.

## The Anatomy of a Block Header

The header is where the magic happens. It's small (about 500 bytes) but contains everything needed to verify the block:

```rust
pub struct Header {
    // Consensus fields
    pub parent_hash: B256,           // Links to previous block
    pub ommers_hash: B256,           // Uncle blocks (mostly unused now)
    pub beneficiary: Address,        // Who gets the fees
    pub state_root: B256,            // Root of the state trie
    pub transactions_root: B256,     // Root of transactions trie
    pub receipts_root: B256,         // Root of receipts trie
    pub withdrawals_root: Option<B256>, // Post-Shanghai
    pub logs_bloom: Bloom,           // Quick log filtering
    pub difficulty: U256,            // Always 0 post-merge
    pub number: u64,                 // Block height
    pub gas_limit: u64,              // Max gas for block
    pub gas_used: u64,               // Actual gas used
    pub timestamp: u64,              // Unix timestamp
    pub extra_data: Bytes,           // Arbitrary data (max 32 bytes)
    pub mix_hash: B256,              // Was PoW, now randomness
    pub nonce: u64,                  // Was PoW, now 0
    pub base_fee_per_gas: Option<u64>, // EIP-1559
    pub blob_gas_used: Option<u64>,    // EIP-4844
    pub excess_blob_gas: Option<u64>,  // EIP-4844
    pub parent_beacon_block_root: Option<B256>, // EIP-4788
}
```

Each field tells a story!

## The Three Roots - Merkle Trees Everywhere

The header contains three critical Merkle roots that serve as "fingerprints" for different aspects of the block:

### 1. State Root - The World State Fingerprint
- **What it proves**: "After executing this block, here's what every account looks like"
- Root of all account states (balances, nonces, code, storage)
- Most expensive to calculate (~80% of block validation time)
- Changes only when account states change

```rust
// State root calculation (simplified)
let mut state_trie = StateTrie::new();
for (address, account) in all_accounts {
    state_trie.insert(keccak256(address), account.encode());
}
let state_root = state_trie.root(); // Expensive!
```

### 2. Transactions Root - The "What Happened" Fingerprint
- **What it proves**: "These exact transactions, in this exact order, were included"
- Root of all transactions in the block
- Order matters! Different order = different root
- Relatively cheap to calculate

```rust
// Order matters example
let tx1 = Transaction { from: alice, to: bob, value: 1_ETH };
let tx2 = Transaction { from: bob, to: alice, value: 1_ETH };

// Different orders give different roots!
let root_a = merkle_root([tx1, tx2]);  // Alice sends first
let root_b = merkle_root([tx2, tx1]);  // Bob sends first
assert_ne!(root_a, root_b); // Different outcomes!
```

### 3. Receipts Root - The "What Actually Happened" Fingerprint
- **What it proves**: "Here's what actually happened when we executed those transactions"
- Root of all transaction receipts (gas used, logs, status)
- Critical for proving events occurred
- Used by light clients to verify log queries

**Why Three Separate Roots?**

1. **Separation of Concerns**: 
   - Transactions = "what was requested"
   - Receipts = "what actually happened"
   - State = "the final result"

2. **Verification Efficiency**: Light clients can verify specific aspects without downloading everything

3. **Fraud Proofs**: Can prove specific transactions were included without revealing the entire block

**Real-world analogy**: 
Think of a restaurant:
- **Transactions root** = The orders placed ("I want a burger")
- **Receipts root** = The bills generated ("Burger: $10, Tax: $1, Total: $11")
- **State root** = The final state ("Kitchen has 99 burgers left, cash register has $11 more")

Change any order, any bill, or any final amount, and the "fingerprint" changes completely!

## Block Body - Where Transactions Live

```rust
pub struct BlockBody {
    pub transactions: Vec<TransactionSigned>,
    pub ommers: Vec<Header>,              // Uncle headers
    pub withdrawals: Option<Vec<Withdrawal>>, // Staking withdrawals
}
```

The body is simple - it's mainly a list of transactions. But the order matters! Transactions execute sequentially, each building on the state changes of the previous one.

## The Sealed Block Pattern - Compile-Time Performance Optimization

Here's a beautiful Rust pattern in Reth that demonstrates the power of type-driven design:

```rust
pub struct SealedBlock {
    pub header: SealedHeader,
    pub body: BlockBody,
}

pub struct SealedHeader {
    pub header: Header,
    pub hash: B256,  // Cached hash - computed once, used many times
}
```

**The Problem Being Solved:**

Block hashes are needed constantly but expensive to compute:

```rust
// Without sealing - expensive repeated computation
let header = get_block_header(12345)?;
let hash1 = keccak256(rlp::encode(&header)); // 1st computation
let hash2 = keccak256(rlp::encode(&header)); // 2nd computation (same result!)
let hash3 = keccak256(rlp::encode(&header)); // 3rd computation (wasteful!)
```

**The Sealed Solution:**

```rust
// With sealing - compute once, cache forever
let sealed_header = seal(header);  // Computes hash once
let hash1 = sealed_header.hash();  // Instant access
let hash2 = sealed_header.hash();  // Instant access  
let hash3 = sealed_header.hash();  // Instant access
```

**Why This Pattern is Brilliant:**

1. **Performance**: Hash computation is expensive (Keccak-256 of RLP-encoded header)
   - ~1000 CPU cycles per hash
   - Needed for lookups, references, validation
   - Can be called hundreds of times per block

2. **Type Safety**: The type system enforces optimization
   ```rust
   // This function REQUIRES a sealed block
   fn insert_block(block: SealedBlock) {
       database.insert(block.hash(), block); // Hash is guaranteed available
   }
   
   // You CAN'T pass an unsealed block
   let unsealed = Block { ... };
   // insert_block(unsealed); // Compile error!
   ```

3. **Immutability Guarantee**: Once sealed, the block can't change
   - Hash and content are forever linked
   - No risk of hash becoming stale
   - Safe to cache aggressively

4. **Zero Runtime Cost**: The pattern adds no runtime overhead
   - Same memory layout as original block
   - Hash is just an additional field
   - Type information erased at runtime

**Real-world analogy**: 
It's like getting a birth certificate. You provide all your details once, get an official document with a unique ID, and then you can use that ID for the rest of your life without having to reprove who you are.

**Common pattern in systems programming**: Rust's type system lets us encode expensive invariants ("this hash has been computed") at compile time, making the fast path (accessing cached hash) completely safe.

## Block Validation - Trust but Verify

Before accepting a block, we validate:

### 1. Header Validation
- Parent exists and is known
- Timestamp is reasonable
- Gas limit follows rules
- Difficulty is 0 (post-merge)

### 2. Body Validation
- Transaction root matches computed root
- All transactions are valid
- Gas used matches sum of receipts

### 3. State Validation
- Execute all transactions
- Verify state root matches
- Most computationally expensive!

## The Evolution Through Hard Forks

Blocks have evolved through Ethereum's history:

### Pre-Merge (Proof of Work)
- `difficulty`: Actual mining difficulty
- `nonce`: Solution to PoW puzzle
- `mix_hash`: PoW verification

### Post-Merge (Proof of Stake)
- `difficulty`: Always 0
- `nonce`: Always 0
- `mix_hash`: RANDAO value from consensus layer

### Shanghai (Withdrawals)
- Added `withdrawals_root`
- Enables staking withdrawals

### Cancun (EIP-4844)
- Added `blob_gas_used` and `excess_blob_gas`
- Supports blob transactions for L2s

## Gas Mechanics in Blocks

Each block has gas constraints:
- **Gas Limit**: Maximum gas available
- **Gas Target**: 15 million (adjusts base fee)
- **Gas Used**: Actual consumption

The base fee adjusts automatically:
```
If gas_used > gas_target: base_fee increases
If gas_used < gas_target: base_fee decreases
```

It's like surge pricing - high demand raises prices!

## The Builder Pattern in Action

Reth uses the builder pattern for block construction:

```rust
let block = Block {
    header: Header {
        parent_hash: previous.hash(),
        number: previous.number + 1,
        timestamp: now(),
        // ... other fields
    },
    body: BlockBody {
        transactions: selected_txs,
        ommers: vec![],
        withdrawals: get_withdrawals(),
    },
};

let sealed = block.seal();  // Compute and cache hash
```

## Rust Patterns in Block Code

### 1. Optional Fields with `Option<T>`
```rust
pub base_fee_per_gas: Option<u64>,
```
This elegantly handles protocol upgrades. Old blocks have `None`, new blocks have `Some(value)`.

### 2. Type State Pattern
```rust
Block -> SealedBlock -> RecoveredBlock
```
Each transformation adds guarantees:
- `Block`: Just data
- `SealedBlock`: Hash is computed
- `RecoveredBlock`: Senders are recovered

### 3. Cheap Cloning with `Arc`
```rust
type BlockBody = Arc<RawBlockBody>;
```
Blocks are large and frequently shared. `Arc` (Atomic Reference Count) allows cheap cloning.

## Uncle Blocks - A Historical Curiosity

Uncle blocks (ommers) were blocks that almost made it:
- Valid blocks that weren't included in the main chain
- Miners got partial rewards for finding them
- Increased security by making mining more inclusive

Post-merge, uncles are always empty, but the field remains for compatibility.

## Your Assignment

1. Calculate the hash of a block header manually
2. Verify a transaction root using the transactions in a block
3. Track how the base fee changes over 100 blocks
4. Find the largest block (by gas used) in the last 1000 blocks

## Questions to Ponder - Detailed Answers

### 1. Why does changing transaction order change the transactions root?

**The Merkle Tree Structure:**

Merkle trees are binary trees where each leaf is a transaction and each internal node is the hash of its children:

```
     Root
    /    \
  H12     H34
  / \     / \
H1  H2  H3  H4
|   |   |   |
T1  T2  T3  T4
```

Changing order changes the tree structure:
- Order [T1,T2,T3,T4] → Root = H(H(H1,H2), H(H3,H4))
- Order [T2,T1,T3,T4] → Root = H(H(H2,H1), H(H3,H4)) ≠ original root

**Why this matters:**
- Transaction order affects final state (Alice pays Bob, then Bob pays Charlie vs reverse)
- Miners/validators choose order to maximize MEV (Maximal Extractable Value)
- Different orders can lead to different state roots too!

### 2. How does the state root prove the entire world state?

**The Merkle Patricia Trie:**

Every account's address is hashed and used as a key in a trie:

```rust
// Simplified proof verification
fn verify_account_balance(address: Address, balance: U256, proof: MerkleProof, state_root: B256) -> bool {
    let key = keccak256(address);
    let value = rlp::encode(&Account { balance, nonce: 0, ... });
    proof.verify(key, value, state_root)
}
```

**The Magic**: If you can provide a valid Merkle proof that links any account to the state root, you've cryptographically proven that account's state without downloading the entire state (~50GB).

**Real-world example**: Light clients use this to verify "Does Alice have enough balance to send this transaction?" without storing all account data.

### 3. Why keep empty uncle arrays post-merge instead of removing the field?

**Backward Compatibility:**

```rust
// Pre-merge block might have uncles
let old_block = Block {
    header: Header { ... },
    body: BlockBody {
        transactions: vec![...],
        uncles: vec![uncle1, uncle2], // Non-empty
        withdrawals: None,
    }
};

// Post-merge block has empty uncles
let new_block = Block {
    header: Header { ... },
    body: BlockBody {
        transactions: vec![...],
        uncles: vec![], // Always empty, but field exists
        withdrawals: Some(vec![...]),
    }
};
```

**Why not remove the field?**
- RLP encoding would change → different transaction/block hashes
- Old code would break (all clients, indexers, APIs)
- Network protocol compatibility would break
- Historical block format would be inconsistent

**Better approach**: Keep the field, document it as "always empty post-merge"

### 4. What happens if a block's timestamp is earlier than its parent?

**Validation Rule**: `block.timestamp > parent.timestamp`

```rust
fn validate_timestamp(block: &Header, parent: &Header) -> Result<()> {
    if block.timestamp <= parent.timestamp {
        return Err("Timestamp not strictly increasing");
    }
    // Also check it's not too far in the future
    if block.timestamp > current_time() + MAX_FUTURE_SECONDS {
        return Err("Timestamp too far in future");
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

**Why this rule exists:**
- **Consensus**: All nodes must agree on block order
- **Security**: Prevents timestamp manipulation attacks
- **UX**: Smart contracts rely on `block.timestamp` for time-based logic

**Real attack scenario without this rule:**
- Malicious miner creates block with timestamp from yesterday
- Time-based contracts (locked tokens, auctions) behave incorrectly
- Network's notion of "time" becomes inconsistent

The rule ensures blockchain time always moves forward, even if wall-clock time is inconsistent across nodes.

## A Feynman Story

When I worked on the atomic bomb, we had to keep meticulous records of every experiment. Each record had a header (when, who, what) and a body (the detailed measurements). If anything was out of order or missing, the whole record was invalid.

Blocks work the same way. The header says "this is block #18,500,000, created at time T, containing these transactions." The body has the actual transactions. And just like our experiment logs, if anything doesn't match up exactly, the whole block is rejected.

The beauty is in the linking - each block points to its parent, creating an unbreakable chain of history. It's like having each day's experimental log reference the previous day's, so you can always trace back to the beginning.

Next lesson, we'll explore accounts - where all this blockchain activity actually changes something!
