# Lesson 5: The Account Model - Where Value Lives

*"It doesn't matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn't matter how smart you are. If it doesn't agree with experiment, it's wrong." - Richard Feynman*

Today we explore accounts - the fundamental entities that hold value and code in Ethereum. Everything of value in Ethereum lives in an account.

## The Two Types of Accounts

Ethereum has two types of accounts, and this distinction is fundamental:

### 1. Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs)
- Controlled by private keys
- Can initiate transactions
- Have no code
- Example: Your MetaMask wallet

### 2. Contract Accounts
- Controlled by code
- Cannot initiate transactions (only respond)
- Have code and storage
- Example: Uniswap, USDC contract

Both types share the same account structure!

## The Account State

Every account has four pieces of state:

```rust
pub struct Account {
    pub nonce: u64,         // Transaction counter
    pub balance: U256,      // Wei balance
    pub bytecode_hash: B256,// Hash of contract code (or empty)
    pub storage_root: B256, // Root of storage trie (or empty)
}
```

Let's understand each field:

### Nonce - The Transaction Counter
For EOAs:
- Increments with each transaction sent
- Prevents replay attacks
- Starts at 0

For Contracts:
- Increments when creating new contracts
- Usually stays at 1
- Critical for CREATE2 address calculation

### Balance - The Money
- Measured in wei (1 ETH = 10^18 wei)
- Can be transferred between accounts
- Protected by the blockchain's consensus

### Bytecode Hash - The Code Fingerprint
For EOAs:
- Always `KECCAK256_EMPTY` (the hash of empty data)
- Immutable (EOAs can never have code)

For Contracts:
- Hash of the contract's bytecode
- Set during contract creation
- Immutable after deployment

### Storage Root - The Data Warehouse
For EOAs:
- Always `EMPTY_ROOT_HASH`
- EOAs have no storage

For Contracts:
- Root of the Merkle Patricia Trie containing all storage
- Changes as storage is modified
- Proves the entire storage state

## The Beauty of the Account Model

Unlike Bitcoin's UTXO model, Ethereum's account model is intuitive:
- Balances are explicit (not computed from unspent outputs)
- State transitions are straightforward
- Supports complex smart contracts naturally

## Account Creation

Accounts spring into existence in three ways:

### 1. Receiving ETH
```rust
// An empty account becomes real when it receives ETH
if !account_exists(address) && value > 0 {
    create_account(address, Account {
        nonce: 0,
        balance: value,
        bytecode_hash: KECCAK256_EMPTY,
        storage_root: EMPTY_ROOT_HASH,
    });
}
```

### 2. Deploying a Contract
```rust
// CREATE or CREATE2 opcode
let new_account = Account {
    nonce: 1,  // Contracts start with nonce 1
    balance: value,
    bytecode_hash: keccak256(bytecode),
    storage_root: EMPTY_ROOT_HASH,
};
```

### 3. Being the Target of CREATE2
Even before deployment, we can compute a CREATE2 address and send ETH to it!

## The AccountInfo Structure

Reth uses `AccountInfo` for runtime representation:

```rust
pub struct AccountInfo {
    pub balance: U256,
    pub nonce: u64,
    pub code_hash: B256,
    pub code: Option<Bytecode>,  // Cached for performance
}
```

Notice the `code` field - this is a performance optimization. Instead of loading code from the database every time, we cache it in memory.

## Empty Accounts and Self-Destruct

Accounts can become empty again:

```rust
fn is_empty(&self) -> bool {
    self.balance.is_zero() && 
    self.nonce == 0 && 
    self.bytecode_hash == KECCAK256_EMPTY
}
```

Empty accounts are removed from the state trie to save space. This happens when:
- All ETH is transferred out
- No transactions have been sent (nonce = 0)
- No code exists

The infamous `SELFDESTRUCT` opcode used to forcibly empty accounts, but it's being phased out for safety reasons.

## Storage - The Contract's Database

Contract storage is a key-value store:
- Keys: 32-byte words (U256)
- Values: 32-byte words (U256)
- Initially all zeros (sparse)

```rust
// Setting storage
SSTORE(key, value)  // Costs 20,000 gas for new slot!

// Reading storage
value = SLOAD(key)  // Costs 2,100 gas
```

Storage is expensive because every node must store it forever!

## Account Optimization in Reth

Reth employs several optimizations:

### 1. Bytecode Deduplication
Many contracts share bytecode (like ERC-20 tokens). Reth stores each unique bytecode once.

### 2. Storage Tries
Each contract's storage is a separate trie, allowing:
- Parallel updates
- Efficient proofs
- Sparse storage

### 3. Account Caching
Frequently accessed accounts are kept in memory to avoid database lookups.

## The State Trie

All accounts live in a giant Merkle Patricia Trie:
```
State Root
    ├── Hash(Address1) → Account1
    ├── Hash(Address2) → Account2
    └── ... millions more
```

The state root in each block header proves the entire world state!

## Rust Patterns in Account Code

### 1. The Default Trait
```rust
impl Default for Account {
    fn default() -> Self {
        Self {
            nonce: 0,
            balance: U256::ZERO,
            bytecode_hash: KECCAK256_EMPTY,
            storage_root: EMPTY_ROOT_HASH,
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Const Values for Performance
```rust
pub const KECCAK256_EMPTY: B256 = /* compile-time computed */;
```

Computing hashes at compile time saves CPU cycles.

### 3. Bitflags for Account Status
```rust
bitflags! {
    struct AccountStatus: u8 {
        const Touched = 0b001;
        const Created = 0b010;
        const SelfDestructed = 0b100;
    }
}
```

Efficiently track account state changes during execution.

## Your Assignment

1. Calculate how much ETH is needed to store 1KB of data on-chain
2. Find a contract with storage and examine its storage layout
3. Compute an EOA address from a public key
4. Track how an account's state changes through a transaction

## Questions to Ponder

1. Why do contracts start with nonce 1 instead of 0?
2. What happens if two transactions try to deploy to the same address?
3. Why is storage so expensive compared to computation?
4. How does the state root prove all account balances?

## A Feynman Story

When I was teaching at Caltech, students often confused "knowing the name of something" with "knowing something." They could tell me "accounts have nonces" but not why.

The nonce is beautiful in its simplicity. It's just a counter, but it solves a fundamental problem: how do you prevent someone from replaying your signed transaction? By including an ever-increasing number that can only be used once!

It's like those numbered tickets at the deli counter. You can't use ticket #42 twice, and you can't use ticket #44 before #43. Simple, elegant, effective.

The entire account model is like this - each piece serves a specific purpose, no more, no less. The balance tracks value, the nonce prevents replays, the code hash identifies contracts, and the storage root proves all data. Together, they enable a world computer.

Next lesson, we'll dive into storage - how Reth persists all this data efficiently!
