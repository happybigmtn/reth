# Reth Lessons Enhancement Progress

## Completed Task: Enhanced Lessons 71-80 with Feynman Teaching Approach

### Analysis of Current State
- Lessons 61-70 represent Production Systems and Advanced Features that node operators actually encounter
- They cover critical topics: database maintenance, snapshot sync, network resilience, rate limiting, and light client support
- The lessons need deeper WHY explanations for production decisions
- Real-world analogies would make operational concepts more accessible
- More connections between concepts would show the production ecosystem
- Common pitfalls and debugging strategies would add practical value

### Enhancement Plan for Lessons 61-70
1. **Lesson 61**: Add deeper WHY explanations for database compaction necessity and real-world maintenance analogies
2. **Lesson 62**: Enhance snapshot sync with distributed systems analogies and trust verification strategies  
3. **Lesson 63**: Expand network resilience with immune system analogies and attack mitigation explanations
4. **Lesson 64**: Deepen rate limiting with traffic control analogies and fairness considerations
